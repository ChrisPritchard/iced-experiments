# Iced-Rs experiments

Project to house projects I have undertaken in order to learn iced-rs, an Elm-based UI framework for rust

There are screenshots of each project, when they're finished, along with a readme in each folder.

## Some ideas (from ChatGPT):

Exploring a new UI programming framework can be an exciting endeavor. Here are some ideas for simple UI applications that you can build to get hands-on experience and familiarize yourself with the framework:

1. To-Do List App: Create a basic to-do list application where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. This will help you understand how to handle user input, manage data, and update the UI accordingly.

2. Weather App: Build a weather application that fetches weather data from an API and displays the current weather conditions for a given location. You can include features like displaying temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather forecasts.

3. Calculator: Develop a simple calculator with a user-friendly interface. Implement basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You can also add additional functionalities like memory storage or scientific calculator features.

4. Image Viewer: Create an application that allows users to browse and view images from a specific directory. Implement features such as zooming, panning, and basic image manipulation like rotation or cropping.

5. Note-Taking App: Design a note-taking application where users can create, edit, and organize their notes. Include features like formatting text, adding images, and categorizing notes with tags or labels.

6. Currency Converter: Develop a currency conversion application that fetches real-time exchange rates and allows users to convert between different currencies. Implement features like selecting the base currency, entering the amount to convert, and displaying the converted value.

7. Recipe Finder: Build an application that fetches recipes from an API based on user preferences or search queries. Display recipe details, including ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information.

8. Task Timer: Create a simple task timer application that helps users track their time spent on different activities or tasks. Include features like starting and stopping timers, displaying elapsed time, and logging completed tasks.

9. Music Player: Design a basic music player that allows users to play, pause, and skip tracks. Implement features like a playlist, volume control, and displaying song metadata.

10. Quiz or Flashcard App: Develop an application for creating and taking quizzes or flashcards. Users can input questions, possible answers, and check their answers for correctness.

Remember to adapt these ideas to the specific features and capabilities of the UI programming framework you are exploring. Good luck with your project!
